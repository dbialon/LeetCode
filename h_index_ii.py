# https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/

# Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation
# is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to
# compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
# index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
# the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
